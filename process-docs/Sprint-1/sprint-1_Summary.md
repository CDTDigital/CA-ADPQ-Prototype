**Sprint 1: (Feb. 13, 2017 to Feb 17, 2017)**
-----------------------------------------

**Summary:**

 - Project Structure (Web and Mobile)
 - DB Design and finalize schema (with DB Scripts)
 - UI Design
 - Define REST API
 - Swagger Integration in Web for API documentation
 - User Login Screens (Web and Mobile)
	* Save User Device Info (Mobile)
 - Setup Docker container
 - User Registration (Continued to Sprint 2)
 - REST APIs for User Login
 - REST APIs for User Registration
 - Documentation of technical approach

**Review feedback:**

 - Is the desktop experience intended for admins only?  I think users may also want to register via the desktop in addition to on their mobile device Desktop--Login page:   
 - I think it would be better to say "Welcome" vs. "Welcome to our page"...or possibly remove the welcome.  The "to our page" piece doesn't feel right to me.
 - "Lets" is spelled incorrectly.  I should be "Let's".
 - Mobile--Login screen: 
      * Again, I would prefer just "Welcome" vs. "Welcome to our system"...or remove the "welcome"
	Registration 
      * Should the password be entered twice?  Most account you setup require this.
 - Set Up Account Page 
      * Perhaps add "Mobile" to "phone number"
      * "Proceed" should be "next" or maybe "continue" as that is more typical in the US
 - Settings Page 
      * What is the difference between a push notification and SMS/email?  My husband and I had a whole conversation about whether SMS and emails were just examples of push notifications, or if push notifications were something separate.  Based on just our confusion, it seems we may want a descriptor of what you get if you enable each item.
      * Additionally, what is meant by location tracking?  The user will want to know.
 - Notifications pages (list & detail)
      * The locations listed should be California-centric since this is a California project.  We should remove Idaho and NY in favor of cities and/or counties in California.  Anthony or I could provide suggestions, if needed.
 
**Retrospective**
-------------------------
**What Went well:**

 - Resource allocation is done on time
 - Able to freeze UI designs
 - DB schema was finalized
 - Struggled alot to integrate swagger but done it on time.
 - Having domain knowledge helped.
 - API definitions are ready.
 
**Needs Improvement:**

 - Integration of REST API for Registration/Login is not started
 - Work flow testing
 - API definitions not reviewed, need to focus of review process more
 - Document review not started
